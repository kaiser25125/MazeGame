The main class that runs the whole game is inside GuiMaze.  All of the files for images and for 
the file that designs the whole game (info.txt) need to be in the parent folder.

A few important notes for specifications inside of the game

-all monsters are 100 by 100 in size in the maze, to change this change the MONSTER_IMAGE_SIZE constant in CustomPaintMaze

-all images get resized to be 50 by 50,  to change this change the ITEM_IMAGE_SIZE constant in CustomPaintMaze

-there are no one sided passage ways.  If a room has a passage to the east there should be a passage to the west from the eastward room

-info.txt describes the maze.  It must be in the same folder of the package of all the code and there is documentation for it in documentationForTxtFile
